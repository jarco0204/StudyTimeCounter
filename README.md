# StudyTimeCounter
Created a portable Arduino program to help switch between two modes of studying (60 min vs. 90 min). After the time is done,  a sound is performed with my buzzer module. This marks the start of the(10 min) break time. My inspiration came from the book the 5AM Club, which stated that it is optimal for our focus to work in periods of deep focus(bulletproof your attention) followed by a small break to not exhaust our mental resources for the day.
